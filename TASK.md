# Test task for .NET developer

## Story
As user I want a tool for evaluating website performance.

## Acceptance criteria
- It should be a web site, ASP.NET MVC (suggestion: you can use
  bootstrap framework)
- It should be a page with text box where user can enter URL
- Application has to determine sitemap of requested URL, sends requests
  to sitemapâ€™s URLs and measure response time.
- Test result should display pages speed graphically (top of the page)
- Test result should display page speed as a table (bottom of the page).  
  Table should contain min and max values for each page
- Slowest requests should be on top
- It should be possible to evaluate tests result history for tested web sites
- Source code for the task should be uploaded to GitHub or Bitbucket

## Notes
Approach, tools, database engine can be selected by candidate.  
It would be super cool in case response time is showed in real time. However
it is not required.
